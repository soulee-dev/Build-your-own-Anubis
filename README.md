# Build Your Own Anubis (PoW Captcha)

## Overview

This project provides a simple implementation of a **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Captcha** system.  
It is designed to help protect websites from **automated scraping and excessive traffic by AI companies** or other bots.  
By requiring clients to solve a computational challenge before accessing resources, the system adds a cost to automated requests while remaining lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Features

- **Proof-of-Work Captcha**  
  Clients must solve a PoW challenge to access protected resources.

- **Configurable Difficulty**  
  Adjust the complexity of the challenge to match your security needs.

- **Lightweight and Self-Hosted**  
  Minimal dependencies, simple to integrate into existing applications.

- **Extensible Design**  
  Core logic can be adapted for different challenge types or integrated into larger security systems.
